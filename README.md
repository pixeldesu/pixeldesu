### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on:
* [TYPO3](https://typo3.org), a free/libre open source CMS
* [Retrospring](https://github.com/retrospring/retrospring), a social Q/A platform
* [Retreev](https://github.com/retreev), a toolset to keep defunct versions of the game [Pangya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PangYa) alive
* [DeckHack](https://github.com/deckhack), a community of TweetDeck enthusiasts and extension developers
* ...and many, many more things. _If I don't build something, I take something apart!_

📫 How to reach me:
* 🐘 [pixel@desu.social](https://desu.social/@pixel)
* 🐦 [@pixeldesu](https://twitter.com/pixeldesu)

🎮 I enjoy playing games (and taking them apart), especially including 🎵

❤️ I'm looking for [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/pixeldesu) to keep my projects maintained and operational
